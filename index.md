# Introduction to Blockchain

Blockchain is a digital, decentralized, distributed ledger.

Blockchain at its core is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger that is cryptographically secure, append-only, immutable, and updateable only via consensus or agreement among peers.

In a blockchain, data is stored in blocks. These blocks are linked together using cryptography. Therefore blockchain is a linked chain of blocks. The name "blockchain" of course is suited it.
As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
The whole blockchain distributed among all nodes (Computers, mobile devices) in the network. Therefore there is no centralized authority.

In 2008, Bitcoin was created. The underlaying technology of bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is blockchain. But cryptocurrency is just a one usage of blockchain technology. There are virtually infinite number of use cases if you really think about it.

Key points of blockchain technology :

- Blockchain facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. Those assets can be tangible or intangible. Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network.

- Blockchain eliminates the need of a trusted third party (such as a bank, a financing company, a broker) to take place a trade.

- A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production, and much more.

- Blockchain creates system of thrust in a not-trusted environment.

Notes:
In 1991, Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta published a paper titled "How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document". Many of features of today's blockchain is included in that paper.
In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published Bitcoin whitepaper which describes the theory and implementation of bitcoin, named "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".
